1.*API*:An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.
- It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.
- A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification.
- A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.
- One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts that a programmer will find useful, and keeping them consistent even if the internal details change later.
- An API may be custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard allowing interoperability among many systems
